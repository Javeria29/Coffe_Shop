# Coffe_Shop
Coffeehouses provide new employees with training so as to become a barista, a person making specialty coffee, even if they don’t have any previous experience. It’s more like working with friends rather than with employers in coffee shops. In a friendly atmosphere you will learn the ropes of serving the best coffee in a matter of few days.
